    <P>This is Flerra. She was once the princess of a beautiful planet. Her fellow rulers used to take part in colonizing and destroying planets for their benefit. Flerra knew this was wrong and fled her home world to save the planets they have destroyed. She has magicial healing tears that heal anything they touch. She has the ability to conjure her sword and shield to further defend planets to protect the life that lives there. </P>
