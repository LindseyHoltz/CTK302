    <h1> The Tale of Flerra</h1>
    <P class="story">This is Flerra. She was once the princess of a beautiful planet. Her fellow rulers and friends would colonize and destroy planets for their benefit. Flerra knew this was wrong and tried to reason with her friends to save life, but they wouldn't listen. She fled her home world to save these planets they have destroyed. She has magical healing tears that heal anything they touch. She has the ability to conjure weapons at will. With sword and shield in hand, she is ready to defend the life she has worked so hard to save from her old friends, now enemies. </P>
